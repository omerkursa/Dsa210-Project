# omerkursad DSA210 Term Project.

This project will be about the global online dating platforms such as "Bumble, Tinder, Okcupid". I will try to analyze the data i'll retrieve online and try to understand how males, females and non-binary people are acting according to different types of people.

My motivation for this kind of project is actually a twitter post I have seen recently. In the aforementioned post, a women created an anonymus  tinder profile and uploaded a picture of a body spray as her profile picture. And used a regular female name. It is important to mention that it is the only picture of the account and there was no any valid information about any human being in the profile. The profile got more than 600 likes in only a several hours. Then I decided to put this on a test. I created a Bumble account for a water bottle. I put photos of the water bottle and named the account "Damla". The results remained unchanged. This gave me the motivation to investigate furthermore. I have a devostating hypothesis. Which is male users do not care about neither personality nor apperance they ara always looking for short term no commitment relationships.

I will upload the changes and also the datasets i will be using in the future.
